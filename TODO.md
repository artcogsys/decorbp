- Check against Constence codebase
- Double check data type precision
- add old learning rule
- analyse if we should or should not rescale with wide networks
- analyse what happens for deep networks
- add cifar10_resnet18 training

- debug different decorrelation variants and losses (L*L; sum of loss exploding; etc)
- add method to all scripts
- check node perturbation (and move forward with that)
