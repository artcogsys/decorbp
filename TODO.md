- Create general training code which can mix backpropagation, node perturbation and decorrelation
- Check against Constence codebase
- Double check data type precision
- Create separate package for node_perturbation
- implement downsampling at level of Decorrelation (on level of patches*samples?)
- factory kwargs for all decorrelation parameters
- add old learning rule
- remove bias
